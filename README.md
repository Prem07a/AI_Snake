# AI_Snake
This is an AI model which trains itself to play the snake game. Concept used: Reinforcement Learning.

This repository contains an implementation of the classic game Snake, which is played by a Deep Q-Learning agent. The agent learns to play the game by training on a neural network, using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.


## INSTALLATION

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Prem07a/AI_Snake.git
```
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## FILES

The following files are included in this repository:
* agent.py: This file contains the Deep Q-Learning agent implementation.
* game.py: This file contains the Snake game implementation.
* helper.py: This file contains helper functions used in the game and agent implementations.
*  model.py: This file contains the neural network model used by the agent.
* arial.ttf: This file contains the font used in the game



## USAGE

To Start the training run the following command:
```
python game.py
```
